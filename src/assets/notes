component?

         Html [Template] -html
		 CSS -css
		[ event handling functions
		 data ] -ts
		 
		 if you call another component
		 
		 <app-child><app-child>
		 
		 the component that is called is called child component
		 
		 each component has its own life cycle usually
		 the lifecycle of child depends on parent life cycle

    

When ever you create a component?

   <app-box></app-box>  - component creation
   
   an object of BoxComponent will be created
   
    <app-box></app-box>
	 <app-box></app-box> - two objects of BoxComponent will be created
	 
object creation is called - [[instantiation]]

in an object ? - data+ functions will be there

   and  this data need to be attached with existing template
   and interpolation need to happend and css need to be applied
   and [[new template will be generated]]
   
   then the component is redered
   
   First [[Rendering is called as [[component initialization]]
   
   user might be interacting with the component as a result
   events might occur
   
   because of the event functions in the object might run
   
   because of this component data might change
   
   because of this component need to re interpolated and rerendered
   
   this activity is called as [[[component update]]]
